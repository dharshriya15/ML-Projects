# Real-time Object Detection with YOLO

## Project Description

This project implements a real-time object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with OpenCV. It features a graphical user interface built with tkinter, allowing users to perform object detection on live webcam feeds or video files. The system also includes logging functionality to record and save detection results.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3
- Graphical user interface for easy interaction
- Support for both webcam and video file input
- Adjustable confidence and threshold settings
- Real-time logging of detected objects
- Ability to save detection logs to CSV files
